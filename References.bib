abstract = {We present three different matrix bases that can be used to decompose density matrices of d-dimensional quantum systems, so-called qudits: the generalized Gell-Mann matrix basis, the polarization operator basis and the Weyl operator basis. Such a decomposition can be identified with a vector - the Bloch vector, i.e. a generalization of the well-known qubit case - and is a convenient expression for comparison with measurable quantities and for explicit calculations avoiding the handling of large matrices. We present a new method to decompose density matrices via so-called standard matrices, consider the important case of an isotropic two-qudit state and decompose it according to each basis. In the case of qutrits we show a representation of an entanglement witness in terms of expectation values of spin-1 measurements, which is appropriate for an experimental realization. {\textcopyright} 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

@article{Fonseca2019,
abstract = {We study the protocol of qudit teleportation using quantum systems subjected to several kinds of noise for arbitrary dimensionality d. We consider four classes of noise: Dit-flip, d-phase-flip, dit-phase-flip, and depolarizing noise, each of them corresponding to a family of Weyl operators, introduced via Kraus formalism. We derive a general expression for the average fidelity of teleportation in arbitrary dimension d for any combination of noise on the involved qudits. Under a different approach we derive the average fidelity of teleportation for a more general scenario involving the d-dimensional generalization of amplitude damping noise as well. We show that all possible scenarios may be classified in four different behaviors and discuss the cases in which it is possible to improve the fidelity by increasing the associated noise fractions. All our results are in agreement with previous analysis for the case of qubits [R. Fortes and G. Rigolin, Phys. Rev. A 92, 012338 (2015)PLRAAN1050-294710.1103/PhysRevA.92.012338].},

abstract = {We compare two approaches to non-Markovian quantum evolution: one based on the concept of divisible maps and the other one based on distinguishability of quantum states. The former concept is fully characterized in terms of local generator whereas it is in general not true for the latter one. A simple example of random unitary dynamics of a qubit shows the intricate difference between those approaches. Moreover, in this case both approaches are fully characterized in terms of local decoherence rates.}
